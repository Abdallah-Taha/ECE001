    <td>ANI is also known as Narrow AI or Weak AI. This form of artificial intelligence focuses mainly on a single,
     narrow mission, with a restricted range of capabilities. If you think of an example of AI that happens right now
      in our lives, it's ANI. It is the only form that's currently around out of the three. This includes Natural Language
       or Siri of all sorts.</td>
     <td>AGI technology would be on a human mental level. Because of this, it's likely to be some time before we fully 
     understand AGI, because we still don't know anything about the human brain itself. However, at least in principle
   , AGI could think on the same level as a human, just like Sonny the robot in I-Robot featuring Will Smith.</td>
   <td>This is where it becomes somewhat theoretical, and a touch scary. ASI refers to AI technology which matches the 
    human mind and then surpasses it. To be classified as an ASI, in every way possible the technology would need to be 
  more capable than a human. These AI things could not only accomplish tasks, but they would even be able to have 
  emotions and relations.</td>
